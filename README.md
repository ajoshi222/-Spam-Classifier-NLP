# -Spam-Classifier-NLP
identify and distinguish between spam (unwanted or malicious) messages and non-spam (legitimate) messages.
Data Collection:

Spam classifiers are trained on datasets that contain examples of both spam and non-spam messages. These datasets are used to teach the classifier what features are indicative of each class.


Feature Extraction:

Textual data (such as the content of emails or messages) is transformed into numerical features that the machine learning model can understand. Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.


Model Training:

The classifier is trained using a machine learning algorithm on the labeled dataset. Common algorithms for spam classification include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and more recently, deep learning approaches.


Prediction:

Once trained, the spam classifier can predict whether a new, unseen message is spam or not based on the features it has learned during training.


Evaluation:

The performance of the spam classifier is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This is typically done on a separate set of data that the model has not seen during training.


Deployment:

After successful training and evaluation, the spam classifier can be deployed in real-world applications. For example, it can be integrated into email servers or messaging platforms to automatically filter out spam messages.


Ongoing Optimization:

Spam classifiers may need to be updated regularly to adapt to changing patterns in spam. This may involve retraining the model with new data or adjusting its parameters.
Handling False 

Positives and Negatives:

False positives (legitimate messages incorrectly classified as spam) and false negatives (spam messages incorrectly classified as legitimate) are common challenges. Optimizing the model and monitoring its performance can help minimize these errors.
